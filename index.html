        <section><h2>Top 3 most common pitches</h2>
        <p>The most common pitch is the 4 seam fastball. The 4 seam fast ball is meant to have speed and be accurate </p>
    <p>The seconf most common pitch is the Slider. The slider is meant to look like a fastball but then drop at the last second to decieve the batter.</p>
<p>The third most common pitch is teh 2 seam or sinker. The sinker is meant to look like a slow pitch before curving towards the plate to make the batter think its an easy hit before sinking.</p></section>

        <p>The catcher will give the pitcher different sighs to the pitcher to tell the pitcher what to throw. The pitcher will nod yes if he likes the call or no if he doesnt, if the pitcher nods no then the pitcher will choose a new call.</p>
    <p>The first signs is just one finger this tells the pitcher to throw a fastball</p>
<p>The second sign is 2 fingers which tells the pitcher to throw a curveball</p>
<p>The tird sighn is 3 fingers which tells the pitcher to throw a slider</p>
<p>The fourth sign is 4 fingers and this will tell the pitcher to throw a changeup</p>
<p>The fifth sign is uncommon but if the pitcher flips the pitcher off then that tells the pitcher to hit ther batter to advance him to 1st base.</p>
